### Hi there, I'm May! ðŸ‘‹

I'am starting in the world of data science.
I am putting into practice what I have learned so far. I'm on the lookout for new challenges and projects to improve my data science expertise. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several data-driven projects to improve my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
<br> <br>
Little by little I will upload the projects I am working on!
